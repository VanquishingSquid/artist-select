This python script selects a random artist you follow. I made it as a way to get through all the artists I have followed but am yet to listen to, without having to scroll through the artists I'm following but have already explored.
Adding artists to a blacklist prevents the artists from showing up again.
The program can be exited any time by typing "x" or "exit".

You must get client and secret keys from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and assign the "client_id" and "client_secret" variables in artist-select.py  to the keys. Set the redirect_uri of your app to "http://localhost".
